# APInt Code Tournament

> Learn code 💻 by playing in game tournament 😛.

My name is Eloi Stree and I want have fun organising coding tournament and teach code for a living.

If you are here as a learner, it means that you are ready to `print` your first `Hello World`.
Or that you are here because you want to battle in the tournaments.

I am going to organise two kinds of online tournament:
- Godot Engine Tournament: We create the game you are playing on
- Game Hack Tournament: We "hack" a game to play on as challenge or speedrun format

There are two important tournament milestone date:
- Last week of Janury: Global Game Jam (1)
- The 12th July: My birthday 😛 (2)

(1) I want to create a game for this project every year during the global game jam and make a tournament after it.
(2) I organised a LAN party at my 20 years old and I would like to orgnaise a real life code tournament at my 40 and 50 (2029-2039)


**Next Hacked Game:**
- 10 Seconds Ninja : Easy to learn
- Hollow Knight : Good challenge(s)
- World of Warcraft : Learn about move and rotation through time
- LifeOff : Socity need junior dev that can move drone with code

**Next Godot Game:**
- Artilery DOS XR: Because we need a Proof Of Concept that is easy to implement and can stand time
- Global Game Jam: Mystery box
- Warcraft Fan Based Battle : Because I love Warcraft 3 and think that Perma-MMØ STR as a code tournament could be fun.


**Sponsor and Teaching**:

I am freelance teacher with not good plan a head.
The projet is open source and under beerware license.
The main income for me and the people helping is going to be, I suppose:
- Tournament sponsors
- workshop in university and secondary school
- Workshop the weekends in Brussels

Hope you a fun with us in this project.
