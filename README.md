# APInt Code Tournament

> Learn code 💻 by playing in game tournaments 😛.   

My name is Eloi Stree and I want to have fun organising coding tournaments and teach for a living.  

If you are here as a learner, it means that you are ready to `print` your first `Hello World`.  
Or that you are here because you want to battle in the tournaments.  

I am going to organise two kinds of online tournaments:  

* Godot Engine Tournament: We create the game you are playing on  
* Game Hack Tournament: We "hack" a game to play on as a challenge or speedrun format  

There are two important tournament milestone dates:  

* Last week of January: Global Game Jam (1)  
* The 12th of July: My birthday 😛 (2)  

_(1) I want to create a game for this project every year during the Global Game Jam and make a tournament after it._     
_(2) I organised a LAN party at my 20th birthday and I would like to organise a real-life code tournament at my 40th and 50th (2029–2039)._    

**Next Hacked Game:**  
* 10 Second Ninja: Easy to learn  
* Hollow Knight: Good challenge(s)   
* World of Warcraft: Learn about movement and rotation through time  
* Liftoff: Society needs junior devs that can move drones with code  

**Next Godot Game:**
* Artillery DOS XR: Because we need a Proof Of Concept that is easy to implement and can stand the test of time    
* Global Game Jam: Mystery box    
* Warcraft Fan-Based Battle: Because I love Warcraft 3 and think that Perma-MMØ STR as a code tournament could be fun    

**Sponsor and Teaching:**  

I am a freelance teacher with not a good plan ahead.     
The project is open source and under the [Beerware license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul-Henning_Kamp#Beerware).   
The main income for me and the people helping is going to be, I suppose:  
* Tournament sponsors  
* Workshops in universities and secondary schools  
* Workshops on weekends in Brussels  

Hope you have fun with us in this project.
